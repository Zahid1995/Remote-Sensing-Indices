# Remote-SensingS-Indices
This will help to calculate Remote Sensing Indices using MODIS reflectance data in Google Earth Engine. 
Furthermore, it can be modified for any remote sensing data e.g. Landsat. But keep in mind that band numbers must be adjusted accordingly.
Copy the code to the google earth engine (GEE) to calculate indices full names and formulas are given in the comments within the code.
The code has been set for a single date image, it can be modified to a time series analysis. 

A total of 18 indices are given including BSI, BUI, EVI, MNDWI, MSAVI, NBI, NDBI, NDDI, NDMI, NDSAI, NDSDI, NDSI-2, NDVI, NDWI, NMDI, OSAVI, SAVI, and UI.
